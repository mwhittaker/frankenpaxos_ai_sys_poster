State machine replication is a critical component of nearly every strongly
consistent distributed system. There are an enormous number of state machine
replication protocols, and every protocol has a lot of configurable parameters.
It's unclear which protocol and which parameter settings yield the best
performance for a given workload.

% TODO: Maybe replace this text with a picture of Paxos vs Fast Paxos to give
% people a good sense for some differences in protocols.
