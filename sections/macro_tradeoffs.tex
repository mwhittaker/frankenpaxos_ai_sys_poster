\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Normal Case Leaders}
    In the normal case, do all commands have to go through a single leader?

  \item \textbf{Generalized}
    Does the state machine replication protocol take advantage of logical
    commutativity? Do logically non-conflicting commands slow each other down
    in the protocol?

  \item \textbf{Collision Leaders}
    Does a single leader have to arbitrate recovery?

  \item \textbf{Optimal Commit Latency}
    Does the protocol achieve the optimal commit latency of three network
    delays?

  \item \textbf{Quorum Sizes}
    What quorum system does the protocol use? Is the protocol flexible to use
    different quorum systems?
\end{itemize}
