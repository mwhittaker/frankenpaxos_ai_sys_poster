\begin{itemize}
  \item The authors of EPaxos implemented EPaxos in Go, so we decided to run their implementation and compare
    what parameters were the most important in their implementation.
  \item The parameters used were: Conflict Rate, Write Percentage, Thriftiness, EPS, Number of Servers, and
    Number of Clients
  \item The Decision Tree predicts EPaxos throughput based on the values of the above parameters

\end{itemize}
