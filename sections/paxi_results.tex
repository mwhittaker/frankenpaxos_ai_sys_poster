\begin{itemize}
    \item Paxi is another evaluation framework that compares the performance of various Paxos protocols. It is
    also written in Go, so we also decided to run their implementations and compare what parameters were the
    most important in their implementation.
    \item The parameters used were: Timeout Thresholds, Buffer Size, Number of Servers, Number of Requests,
    Throttle, Conflict Rate, and Number of Clients
    \item The Decision Tree predicts EPaxos throughput based on the values of the above parameters
\end{itemize}
